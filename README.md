## Branching strategy

This project uses the the standard git-flow branching strategy
in case you are not familure with you may like to review the [github git-flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
or just get the commands on the [git-flow cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

## TTD Framework

TDD is done by using the pytest framework utilizing, mock and patch
While mocking the architecture first it will automatically gain the interfaces of the different software modules.
All tasks should start with tests in branching and follow with the modules development.
